# LeetCode

## Introduction

Code relating to [LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com) solutions can be found here.

## Structure

I have created a separate folder for each question. Each folder will have a
`solutions.py` file with solutions written in Python. I typically tend to code
in the most recent version of Python, `3.10.0` at the time of writing, and the
solutions may reflect this, incorporating features not yet available in earlier
versions. I have eschewed LeetCode's class structure for solutions; all
solutions are in the same file, and the functions are named `solution_i`,
where `i` is the number of the solution to the question. I will attempt to
abide by this, but may utilize classes where multiple functions need to
be grouped together to solve a problem. They shall similarly be named `Solutioni`.
Each solution will be explained in an `explanation.md` file, also in the same
question folder. This will contain a discussion of how the solution works,
along with its time and space complexity.

## Plans

Currently, my plan is to upload solutions to all LeetCode algorithm problems,
starting with the easy ones, then the medium ones, then, finally, the hard ones.
Star this repo to keep up to date with my solutions!
