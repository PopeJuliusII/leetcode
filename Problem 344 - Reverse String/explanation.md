## Solution 1

### Solution 1: Explanation

This solution uses two pointers to reverse the list.

### Solution 1: Space Complexity

`O(1)`. Nothing is stored; everything happens in-place.

### Solution 1: Time Complexity

`O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `s`.

## Solution 2

### Solution 2: Explanation

This solution uses the built-in `reverse` function.
Whilst it is a facetious answer, try and see which one is
faster. Run a loop of 100,000 with lists from 1 to 100.
Although this is not an appropriate answer to give when
asked this question, I have included it as a brief
reminder that built-in methods may be significantly
faster than our own implementation of them.

### Solution 2: Space Complexity

`O(1)`. Nothing is stored; everything happens in-place.

### Solution 2: Time Complexity

`O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `s`.
