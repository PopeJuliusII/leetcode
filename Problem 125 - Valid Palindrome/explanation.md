## Solution 1

### Solution 1: Explanation

This solution uses a `for` loop and two pointers, `i` and `p`.
If the twain meet, we have a palindrome. If they do not, we do not.

### Solution 1: Space Complexity

`O(1)`. We only use pointers.

### Solution 1: Time Complexity

`O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `s`.

## Solution 2

### Solution 2: Explanation

This solution a uses `while` loop and two pointers, `left` and `right`.
If the twain meet, we have a palindrome. If they do not, we do not.

### Solution 2: Space Complexity

`O(1)`. We only use pointers.

### Solution 2: Time Complexity

`O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `s`.
